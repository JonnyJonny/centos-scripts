Recommandations
----------------

- First, install prerequistes and reboot your server
- Then, install your server (i.e. srv-***)
- Finally, update the security policy (depends on your own case)

Enjoy :)

How does it work?
----------------

Each installation kind has it own directory.
In each directory we must have:
- some bash scripts
- test.bash : this script will check if installation is well passed.

**Note**: directory name must have the same name as the installation kind.
